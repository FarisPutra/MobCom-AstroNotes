## Why this app exist?

The main reason why this app exists is for learning purposes, that is, to demonstrate how the Clean Architecture pattern can be implemented in Android development. By using this pattern, the app can achieve several benefits, such as:
- Separating the concerns of different layers of the application, such as presentation, business logic, data access, etc.
- Encapsulating the implementation details of each layer and exposing only the interfaces that are needed by other layers.
- Reducing the coupling between different components of the application and making them more manageable for testing and more maintainable.
- Improving the readability and reusability of the code by following consistent naming conventions and design principles.

## Features

AstroNotes is a note-taking app that lets you:
- Create, edit, and delete sticky notes with titles and content bodies.
- Use predefined colors to tag your notes with different meanings.
- Sort your notes by title, date, or color.

## Extra

Truth (better) be told, this was not what I had originally planned. This was some sort of a backup plan, in case I believed I couldn't make it in time. What I previously wanted to create is kind of a local digital library app<s>, a little more elaboration about that app could be found [here](#)</s>. In short, at some point back then, I figured it would probably better for me to find a more suitable project idea, since I know for sure I wouldn't be able to complete it. Here are some justifiable reasons (or at least that's what I think):
1) **Time restriction**; The planning stage already took a month. The development process would easily take much longer than that.
2) **Lack of experience**; My knowledge in Android Development is simply not sufficient enough to take on such a complex project.
3) **Management issue**; At that time, (and perhaps still being the case as of this writing,) there are already many works that need to be done.

So, with reasons above that I had in mind, I gave away on taking that project.  
Did I regret my decision? Probably... **not**.  
Well, the idea of that project is naturally better than this one, but it would be *very hard* to jump into making that application, especially when I pretty much don't have any experience. I'll need to work on something less complicated first, and *this* is the project used as a learning step to progress further onto my long journey of Android Development.

Yeah, that's basically it!  
Thank you for reading up to this point.  
Stay healthy and have a great day! :D
